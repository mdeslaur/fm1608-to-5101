# FM1608 to 5101 ram adapter

This is a small adapter board to use inexpensive DIP FM1608 FRAM memory
chip in games that require a 5101 static ram to save ram contents during
power off so a battery is no longer required.

For example, it can be used in Midway Omega Race or Williams Defender.

A 74HCT00 ic is required to handle the 5101's dual chip enable lines.

This design has not been tested yet, but will be soon.

Gerbers, BOM, and other files to get the boards fabricated by JLCPCB are
located in the production directory.

A PDF of the schematic, and some 3d rendering images are in the docs
directory.
